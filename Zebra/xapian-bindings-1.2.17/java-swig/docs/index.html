How to build the bindings:
==========================

Running "make" and then "make install" will "install" a JNI glue shared library
into a "built" subdirectory of the java build directory.  The jar file is built
into the "built" subdirectory too.

You can copy these two files into your java installation, or just use them
in-place.

How to compile the examples:
============================

  cd java
  javac -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. org/xapian/examples/SimpleIndex.java
  javac -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. org/xapian/examples/SimpleSearch.java

How to run the examples:
========================

To run the examples, you need to give Java a special system-property named
"java.library.path".  The value of this property is the path of the directory
where the libxapian_jni.so (or whatever extension is used on your platform)
JNI library is located.

 java -Djava.library.path=built -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. \
      org.xapian.examples.SimpleIndex ./test.db index words like java

 java -Djava.library.path=built -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. \
      org.xapian.examples.SimpleSearch ./test.db index words like java

Alternatively, you can avoid needing the -Djava.library.path setting by
setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or by installing the JNI
library in the appropriate directory so your JVM finds it automatically
(for example, on Mac OS X you can copy it into /Library/Java/Extensions/).

The java bindings have been tested recently with OpenJDK 1.6.0_18, though
they should work with any java toolchain with suitable JNI support - please
report success stories or any problems to the development mailing list:
xapian-devel@lists.xapian.org

Naming of wrapped methods:
==========================

Methods are renamed to match Java's naming conventions.  So get_mset becomes
getMSet, etc.  Also get_description is wrapped as toString.

MatchAll and MatchNothing
=========================

In Xapian 1.3.0 and later, these are wrapped as static constants
``Query.MatchAll`` and ``Query.MatchNothing``.

If you want to be compatible with earlier versions, you can continue to use
``new Query("")`` instead of ``Query.MatchAll`` and ``new Query()`` instead of
``Query.MatchNothing``.

TODO list:
==========

* Finish updating this document for the move to the SWIG-generated Java
  bindings.

* Write SimpleExpand.java.

* Fix string passing to be zero-byte clean.

* Check that the missing wrappers in the JNI bindings are now present and
  add them to SmokeTest:

* Wrap optional parameter "parameter" for Query ctor.

* Wrap new QueryParser API.

* Wrap changes to Enquire sorting API.

* Use Stem::operator() rather than Stem::stem_word().

* Wrap new method ESet::back().

* Wrap the new optional third parameter to Enquire::set_sorting().

* Third (optional) argument to Document::add_posting() isn't wrapped.

* Wrap Xapian::Weight and standard subclasses.

* Allow user derived weight classes to be implemented in Java (less important).
