General
-------

The "smoketest" is now a bit misnamed as it is rather more than a smoketest in
most cases, and also the different versions aren't in step as to what is
tested...

Try to further reduce the compiled size of the glue code and the time it takes
to compile.  Reworking exception handling made a huge difference!

C#
--

Sort out names which constants get wrapped as.

Write custom typemaps for constructing a query from list of Query objects
and/or terms.

Perhaps write custom typemaps for Enquire::get_matching_terms().

Passing string from C++ to C# and back isn't zero byte safe currently.

Ruby
----

Should we be renaming get_* methods which take parameters?

If a set_XXX method can take more than one parameter, but also has a one
parameter form, should we overload that form as XXX=?

Should we wrap the extra method Enquire::get_matching_terms()?  It seems
to rather duplicate the iterator->arrays mapping.

Merge the Xapian C++ documentation with the RDoc.
One way to do this would be to make a stub Ruby file defining empty methods
according to the Xapian API with appropriate RDoc comments for the purpose of
generating RDocs.

Add test for zero byte clean string passing.

Add test of exception handling.
