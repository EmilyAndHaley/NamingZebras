Construct a BM25Weight.

Xapian::BM25Weight::BM25Weight(double k1, double k2, double k3, double

Parameters:
-----------

k1:  A non-negative parameter controlling how influential within-
document- frequency (wdf) is. k1=0 means that wdf doesn't affect the
weights. The larger k1 is, the more wdf influences the weights.
(default 1)

k2:  A non-negative parameter which controls the strength of a
correction factor which depends upon query length and normalised
document length. k2=0 disable this factor; larger k2 makes it
stronger. (default 0)

k3:  A non-negative parameter controlling how influential within-
query- frequency (wqf) is. k3=0 means that wqf doesn't affect the
weights. The larger k3 is, the more wqf influences the weights.
(default 1)

b:  A parameter between 0 and 1, controlling how strong the document
length normalisation of wdf is. 0 means no normalisation; 1 means full
normalisation. (default 0.5)

min_normlen:  A parameter specifying a minimum value for normalised
document length. Normalised document length values less than this will
be clamped to this value, helping to prevent very short documents
getting large weights. (default 0.5) ";

void Xapian::Database::reopen()

This re-opens the database(s) to the latest available version(s). It
can be used either to make sure the latest results are returned, or to
recover from a Xapian::DatabaseModifiedError.

Calling reopen() on a database which has been closed (with  close())
will always raise a Xapian::DatabaseError. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::close "

Close the database.

virtual void Xapian::Database::close()

This closes the database and closes all its file handles.

For a WritableDatabase, if a transaction is active it will be aborted,
while if no transaction is active commit() will be implicitly called.
Also the write lock is released.

Closing a database cannot be undone - in particular, calling reopen()
after close() will not reopen it, but will instead throw a
Xapian::DatabaseError exception.

Calling close() again on a database which has already been closed has
no effect (and doesn't raise an exception).

After close() has been called, calls to other methods of the database,
and to methods of other objects associated with the database, will
either:

behave exactly as they would have done if the database had not been
closed (this can only happen if all the required data is cached)

raise a Xapian::DatabaseError exception indicating that the database
is closed.

The reason for this behaviour is that otherwise we'd have to check
that the database is still open on every method call on every object
associated with a Database, when in many cases they are working on
data which has already been loaded and so they are able to just behave
correctly.

This method was added in Xapian 1.1.0. ";

Parameters:
-----------

tname:  The termname to iterate postings for. If the term name is the
empty string, the iterator returned will list all the documents in the

This is functionally similar to getting an iterator with
allterms_begin() and then calling skip_to(prefix) on that iterator to

An iterator which returns all user-specified metadata keys.

Xapian::TermIterator Xapian::Database::metadata_keys_begin(const
std::string &prefix=std::string()) const

When invoked on a Xapian::Database object representing multiple
databases, currently only the metadata for the first is considered but
this behaviour may change in the future.

If the backend doesn't support metadata, then this method returns an
iterator which compares equal to that returned by metadata_keys_end().

Parameters:
-----------

prefix:  If non-empty, only keys with this prefix are returned.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if the backend implements
user-specified metadata, but doesn't implement iterating its keys
(currently this happens for the InMemory backend). ";

with copydatabase, or xapian-compact) will have different UUIDs.

If the backend does not support UUIDs or this database has no
subdatabases, the UUID will be empty.

Parameters:
-----------

slot_:  The value number to return from operator().

str_:  A string to look for to recognise values as belonging to this
date range.

prefix_:  Whether to look for the string at the start or end of the
values. If true, the string is a prefix; if false, the string is a
suffix (default: true).

prefer_mdy_:  Should ambiguous dates be interpreted as month/day/year
rather than day/month/year? (default: false)

epoch_year_:  Year to use as the epoch for dates with 2 digit years
(default: 1970, so 1/1/69 is 2069 while 1/1/70 is 1970).

The string supplied in str_ is used by operator() to decide whether
the pair of strings supplied to it constitute a valid range. If
prefix_ is true, the first value in a range must begin with str_ (and
the second value may optionally begin with str_); if prefix_ is false,
the second value in a range must end with str_ (and the first value
may optionally end with str_).

If str_ is empty, the setting of prefix_ is irrelevant, and no special
strings are required at the start or end of the strings defining the
range.

The remainder of both strings defining the endpoints must be valid
dates.

For example, if str_ is \"created:\" and prefix_ is true, and the
range processor has been added to the queryparser, the queryparser
will accept \"created:1/1/2000..31/12/2001\". ";

Xapian::DateValueRangeProcessor::DateValueRangeProcessor(Xapian::valueno

This is like the previous version, but with const char * instead of
std::string - we need this overload as otherwise
DateValueRangeProcessor(1, \"date:\") quietly interprets the second
argument as a boolean in preference to std::string. If you want to be
compatible with 1.2.12 and earlier, then explicitly convert to
std::string, i.e.: DateValueRangeProcessor(1, std::string(\"date:\"))

Parameters:
-----------

slot_:  The value number to return from operator().

str_:  A string to look for to recognise values as belonging to this
date range.

prefix_:  Whether to look for the string at the start or end of the
values. If true, the string is a prefix; if false, the string is a
suffix (default: true).

prefer_mdy_:  Should ambiguous dates be interpreted as month/day/year
rather than day/month/year? (default: false)

epoch_year_:  Year to use as the epoch for dates with 2 digit years

Read weights from a value which is known to decrease as docid

This posting source can be used, like ValueWeightPostingSource, to add
a weight contribution to a query based on the values stored in a slot.
The values in the slot must be serialised as by  sortable_serialise().

However, this posting source is additionally given a range of document
IDs, within which the weight is known to be decreasing. ie, for all
documents with ids A and B within this range (including the
endpoints), where A is less than B, the weight of A is less than or
equal to the weight of B. This can allow the posting source to skip to
the end of the range quickly if insufficient weight is left in the
posting source for a particular source.

By default, the range is assumed to cover all document IDs.

The ordering property can be arranged at index time, or by sorting an
indexed database to produce a new, sorted, database. ";

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource*
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::clone() const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way

language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1 ";

Set this PostingSource to the start of the list of postings.

void Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::init(const

This is called automatically by the matcher prior to each query being
processed.

If a PostingSource is used for multiple searches,  init() will
therefore be called multiple times, and must handle this by using the
database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: the database supplied to this method must not be modified: in
particular, the reopen() method should not be called on it.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or
returned from, the PostingSource refer to docids in that single

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so next()
must be called before any methods which need the context of the
current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid
min_docid, Xapian::weight min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::check(Xapian::docid
min_docid, Xapian::weight min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.

A handle representing a document in a Xapian database.

The Document class fetches information from the database lazily.
Usually this behaviour isn't visible to users (except for the speed
benefits), but if the document in the database is modified or deleted,
then preexisting Document objects may return the old or new versions
of data (or throw Xapian::DocNotFoundError in the case of deletion).

Since Database objects work on a snapshot of the database's state, the
situation above can only happen with a WritableDatabase object, or if
you call Database::reopen() on a Database object.

We recommend you avoid designs where this behaviour is an issue, but
if you need a way to make a non-lazy version of a Document object, you

// File: classXapian_1_1Enquire.xml
%feature("docstring") Xapian::Enquire "

This class provides an interface to the information retrieval system
for the purpose of searching.

Databases are usually opened lazily, so exceptions may not be thrown
where you would expect them to be. You should catch Xapian::Error
exceptions when calling any method in Xapian::Enquire.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if an invalid argument
is supplied, for example, an unknown database type. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::Enquire "

Copying is allowed (and is cheap).

Xapian::Enquire::Enquire(const Enquire &other) ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::Enquire "

Create a Xapian::Enquire object.

Xapian::Enquire::Enquire(const Database &database, ErrorHandler
*errorhandler_=0)

This specification cannot be changed once the Xapian::Enquire is
opened: you must create a new Xapian::Enquire object to access a
different database, or set of databases.

The database supplied must have been initialised (ie, must not be the
result of calling the Database::Database() constructor). If you need
to handle a situation where you have no index gracefully, a database
created with InMemory::open() can be passed here, which represents a
completely empty database.

Parameters:
-----------

database:  Specification of the database or databases to use.

errorhandler_:  A pointer to the error handler to use. Ownership of
the object pointed to is not assumed by the Xapian::Enquire object -
the user should delete the Xapian::ErrorHandler object after the
Xapian::Enquire object is deleted. To use no error handler, this
parameter should be 0.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if an empty Database
object is supplied. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::~Enquire "

Close the Xapian::Enquire object.

Xapian::Enquire::~Enquire() ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_query "

Set the query to run.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_query(const Xapian::Query &query,
Xapian::termcount qlen=0)

Parameters:
-----------

query:  the new query to run.

qlen:  the query length to use in weight calculations - by default the
sum of the wqf of all terms is used. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::get_query "

Get the query which has been set.

const Xapian::Query& Xapian::Enquire::get_query() const

This is only valid after set_query() has been called.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if query has not yet
been set. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::add_matchspy "

Add a matchspy.

void Xapian::Enquire::add_matchspy(MatchSpy *spy)

This matchspy will be called with some of the documents which match
the query, during the match process. Exactly which of the matching
documents are passed to it depends on exactly when certain
optimisations occur during the match process, but it can be controlled
to some extent by setting the checkatleast parameter to  get_mset().

In particular, if there are enough matching documents, at least the
number specified by checkatleast will be passed to the matchspy. This
means that you can force the matchspy to be shown all matching
documents by setting checkatleast to the number of documents in the
database.

Parameters:
-----------

spy:  The MatchSpy subclass to add. The caller must ensure that this
remains valid while the Enquire object remains active, or until
clear_matchspies() is called. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::clear_matchspies "

Remove all the matchspies.

void Xapian::Enquire::clear_matchspies() ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_weighting_scheme "

Set the weighting scheme to use for queries.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_weighting_scheme(const Weight &weight_)

Parameters:
-----------

weight_:  the new weighting scheme. If no weighting scheme is
specified, the default is BM25 with the default parameters. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_collapse_key "

Set the collapse key to use for queries.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_collapse_key(Xapian::valueno collapse_key,
Xapian::doccount collapse_max=1)

Parameters:
-----------

collapse_key:  value number to collapse on - at most one MSet entry
with each particular value will be returned (default is
Xapian::BAD_VALUENO which means no collapsing).

collapse_max:  Max number of items with the same key to leave after
collapsing (default 1).

The MSet returned by get_mset() will have only the \"best\" (at most)
collapse_max entries with each particular value of collapse_key
(\"best\" being highest ranked - i.e. highest weight or highest
sorting key).

An example use might be to create a value for each document containing
an MD5 hash of the document contents. Then duplicate documents from
different sources can be eliminated at search time by collapsing with
collapse_max = 1 (it's better to eliminate duplicates at index time,
but this may not be always be possible - for example the search may be
over more than one Xapian database).

Another use is to group matches in a particular category (e.g. you
might collapse a mailing list search on the Subject: so that there's
only one result per discussion thread). In this case you can use
get_collapse_count() to give the user some idea how many other results
there are. And if you index the Subject: as a boolean term as well as
putting it in a value, you can offer a link to a non-collapsed search
restricted to that thread using a boolean filter. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_docid_order "

Set the direction in which documents are ordered by document id in the
returned MSet.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_docid_order(docid_order order)

This order only has an effect on documents which would otherwise have
equal rank. For a weighted probabilistic match with no sort value,
this means documents with equal weight. For a boolean match, with no
sort value, this means all documents. And if a sort value is used,
this means documents with equal sort value (and also equal weight if
ordering on relevance after the sort).

Parameters:
-----------

order:  This can be: Xapian::Enquire::ASCENDING docids sort in
ascending order (default)

Xapian::Enquire::DESCENDING docids sort in descending order

Xapian::Enquire::DONT_CARE docids sort in whatever order is most
efficient for the backend

Note: If you add documents in strict date order, then a boolean search
- i.e. set_weighting_scheme( Xapian::BoolWeight()) - with
set_docid_order(Xapian::Enquire::DESCENDING) is an efficient way to
perform \"sort by date, newest first\", and with
set_docid_order(Xapian::Enquire::ASCENDING) a very efficient way to
perform \"sort by date, oldest first\". ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_cutoff "

Set the percentage and/or weight cutoffs.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_cutoff(Xapian::percent percent_cutoff,
Xapian::weight weight_cutoff=0)

Parameters:
-----------

percent_cutoff:  Minimum percentage score for returned documents. If a
document has a lower percentage score than this, it will not appear in
the MSet. If your intention is to return only matches which contain
all the terms in the query, then it's more efficient to use
Xapian::Query::OP_AND instead of Xapian::Query::OP_OR in the query
than to use set_cutoff(100). (default 0 => no percentage cut-off).

weight_cutoff:  Minimum weight for a document to be returned. If a
document has a lower score that this, it will not appear in the MSet.
It is usually only possible to choose an appropriate weight for cutoff
based on the results of a previous run of the same query; this is thus
mainly useful for alerting operations. The other potential use is with
a user specified weighting scheme. (default 0 => no weight cut-off).

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance "

Set the sorting to be by relevance only.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance()

Set the sorting to be by value only.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_sort_by_value(Xapian::valueno sort_key, bool
reverse)

Note that sorting by values uses a string comparison, so to use this
to sort by a numeric value you'll need to store the numeric values in
a manner which sorts appropriately. For example, you could use
Xapian::sortable_serialise() (which works for floating point numbers
as well as integers), or store numbers padded with leading zeros or
spaces, or with the number of digits prepended.

Parameters:

Note that with the default BM25 weighting scheme parameters, non-
identical documents will rarely have the same weight, so this setting
will give very similar results to set_sort_by_relevance(). It becomes
more useful with particular BM25 parameter settings (e.g.
BM25Weight(1,0,1,0,0)) or custom weighting schemes.

Parameters:
-----------

sort_key:  value number to sort on.

reverse:  If true, reverses the sort order of sort_key. Beware that in
1.2.16 and earlier, the sense of this parameter was incorrectly
inverted and inconsistent with the other set_sort_by_... methods. This

Get terms which match a given document, by document id.

TermIterator Xapian::Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin(Xapian::docid
did) const

This method returns the terms in the current query which match the
given document.

It is possible for the document to have been removed from the database
between the time it is returned in an MSet, and the time that this
call is made. If possible, you should specify an MSetIterator instead
of a Xapian::docid, since this will enable database backends with
suitable support to prevent this occurring.

Note that a query does not need to have been run in order to make this
call.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id for which to retrieve the matching terms.

An iterator returning the terms which match the document. The terms
will be returned (as far as this makes any sense) in the same order as
the terms in the query. Terms will not occur more than once, even if
they do in the query.

Parameters:
-----------

This method returns the terms in the current query which match the

If the underlying database has suitable support, using this call
(rather than passing a Xapian::docid) will enable the system to ensure
that the correct data is returned, and that the document has not been
deleted or changed since the query was performed.

Parameters:

Return the weight contribution for the current document.

Xapian::weight Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_weight() const

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

void Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::next(Xapian::weight min_wt)

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so next()
must be called before any methods which need the context of the
current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid
min_docid, Xapian::weight min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::check(Xapian::docid min_docid,
Xapian::weight min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to check.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::at_end "

Return true if the current position is past the last entry in this

this method is first called. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_docid "

Return the current docid.

Xapian::docid Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_docid() const

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". See  get_weight() for details.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the returned docid
should be in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

FixedWeightPostingSource* Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::clone()
const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way
(for example when wrapping the Xapian API for use from another
language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1 ";

included in the name, using \"::\" as a separator. For example, for a
PostingSource subclass called \"FooPostingSource\" in the \"Xapian\"
namespace the result of this call should be
\"Xapian::FooPostingSource\".

database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: the database supplied to this method must not be modified: in
particular, the reopen() method should not be called on it.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or

Get a Xapian::Document object for the current position.

Xapian::Document Xapian::MSetIterator::get_document() const

This method returns a Xapian::Document object which provides the
information about the document pointed to by the MSetIterator.

If the underlying database has suitable support, using this call
(rather than asking the database for a document based on its document
ID) will enable the system to ensure that the correct data is
returned, and that the document has not been deleted or changed since
the query was performed.

The estimate will always be less than or equal to the actual number of
other documents satisfying the match criteria with the same collapse
key as this document.

This method may return 0 even though there are other documents with
the same collapse key which satisfying the match criteria. However if
this method returns non-zero, there definitely are other such
documents. So this method may be used to inform the user that there
are \"at least N other matches in this group\", or to control whether

Xapian::percent Xapian::MSetIterator::get_percent() const

The return value will be an integer in the range 0 to 100: 0 meaning
that the item did not match the query at all.

The intention is that the highest weighted document will get 100 if it
matches all the weight-contributing terms in the query. However,
currently it may get a lower percentage score if you use a
MatchDecider and the sorting is primarily by value. In this case, the
percentage for a particular document may vary depending on the first,
max_size, and checkatleast parameters passed to Enquire::get_mset()

KeyMaker subclass which combines several values.

When the result is used for sorting, results are ordered by the first
value. In the event of a tie, the second is used. If this is the same
for both, the third is used, and so on. If reverse is true for a
value, then the sort order for that value is reversed.

When used for collapsing, the documents will only be considered equal
if all the values specified match. If none of the specified values are
set then the generated key will be empty, so such documents won't be
collapsed (which is consistent with the behaviour in the \"collapse on
a value\" case). If you'd prefer that documents with none of the keys
set are collapsed together, then you can set reverse for at least one

So: MultiValueSorter sorter;     // Primary ordering is forwards on

Xapian::NumberValueRangeProcessor::NumberValueRangeProcessor "

Constructor.

Xapian::NumberValueRangeProcessor::NumberValueRangeProcessor(Xapian::valueno

Parameters:
-----------

slot_:  The value number to return from operator().

str_:  A string to look for to recognise values as belonging to this
numeric range.

prefix_:  Whether to look for the string at the start or end of the
values. If true, the string is a prefix; if false, the string is a
suffix (default: true).

The string supplied in str_ is used by operator() to decide whether
the pair of strings supplied to it constitute a valid range. If
prefix_ is true, the first value in a range must begin with str_ (and
the second value may optionally begin with str_); if prefix_ is false,
the second value in a range must end with str_ (and the first value
may optionally end with str_).

If str_ is empty, the setting of prefix_ is irrelevant, and no special
strings are required at the start or end of the strings defining the
range.

The remainder of both strings defining the endpoints must be valid
floating point numbers. (FIXME: define format recognised).

For example, if str_ is \"$\" and prefix_ is true, and the range
processor has been added to the queryparser, the queryparser will
accept \"$10..50\" or \"$10..$50\", but not \"10..50\" or \"10..$50\"
as valid ranges. If str_ is \"kg\" and prefix_ is false, the
queryparser will accept \"10..50kg\" or \"10kg..50kg\", but not
\"10..50\" or \"10kg..50\" as valid ranges. ";

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so next()

current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

virtual bool Xapian::PostingSource::check(Xapian::docid did,
Xapian::weight min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

virtual PostingSource* Xapian::PostingSource::clone() const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemmer "

Set the stemmer.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemmer(const Xapian::Stem &stemmer)

This sets the stemming algorithm which will be used by the query
parser. Note that the stemming algorithm will only be used according
to the stemming strategy set by set_stemming_strategy(), which
defaults to STEM_NONE. Therefore, to use a stemming algorithm, you
will also need to call set_stemming_strategy() with a value other than
STEM_NONE.

Parameters:
-----------

stemmer:  The Xapian::Stem object to set. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemming_strategy "

Set the stemming strategy.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemming_strategy(stem_strategy
strategy)

This controls how the query parser will apply the stemming algorithm.
Note that the stemming algorithm is only applied to words in
probabilistic fields - boolean filter terms are never stemmed.

Parameters:
-----------

strategy:  The strategy to use - possible values are: STEM_NONE: Don't
perform any stemming. (default in Xapian <= 1.3.0)

STEM_SOME: Search for stemmed forms of terms except for those which
start with a capital letter, or are followed by certain characters
(currently: (/@<>=*[{\" ), or are used with operators which need
positional information. Stemmed terms are prefixed with 'Z'. (default
in Xapian >= 1.3.1)

STEM_ALL: Search for stemmed forms of all words (note: no 'Z' prefix
is added).

STEM_ALL_Z: Search for stemmed forms of all words (note: 'Z' prefix is
added). (new in Xapian 1.2.11 and 1.3.1) ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_stopper "

-----------

stop:  The Stopper object to set (default NULL, which means no
stopwords). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_default_op "

Set the default operator.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_default_op(Query::op default_op)

Parameters:
-----------

default_op:  The operator to use to combine non-filter query items
when no explicit operator is used.

The most useful values for this are OP_OR (the default) and OP_AND.
OP_NEAR and OP_PHRASE can also be useful.

So for example, 'weather forecast' is parsed as if it were 'weather OR
forecast' by default. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_database "

Specify the database being searched.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_database(const Database &db)

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database to use for wildcard expansion (FLAG_WILDCARD and
FLAG_PARTIAL), spelling correction (FLAG_SPELLING_CORRECTION), and
synonyms (FLAG_SYNONYM, FLAG_AUTO_SYNONYMS, and
FLAG_AUTO_MULTIWORD_SYNONYMS). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_max_wildcard_expansion
"

Specify the maximum expansion of a wildcard term.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_max_wildcard_expansion(Xapian::termcount
limit)

Note: you must also set FLAG_WILDCARD for wildcard expansion to
happen.

Parameters:
-----------

limit:  The maximum number of terms each wildcard in the query can
expand to, or 0 for no limit (which is the default). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::parse_query "

Parse a query.

Query Xapian::QueryParser::parse_query(const std::string
&query_string, unsigned flags=FLAG_DEFAULT, const std::string
&default_prefix=std::string())

Parameters:
-----------

query_string:  A free-text query as entered by a user

flags:  Zero or more Query::feature_flag specifying what features the
QueryParser should support. Combine multiple values with bitwise-or
(|) (default FLAG_DEFAULT).

default_prefix:  The default term prefix to use (default none). For
example, you can pass \"A\" when parsing an \"Author\" field.

Parameters:
-----------

If:  the query string can't be parsed, then Xapian::QueryParserError
is thrown. You can get an English error message to report to the user
by catching it and calling get_msg() on the caught exception. The
current possible values (in case you want to translate them) are: @li
Unknown range operation  @li parse error  @li Syntax:
&lt;expression&gt; AND &lt;expression&gt;  @li Syntax:
&lt;expression&gt; AND NOT &lt;expression&gt;  @li Syntax:

&lt;expression&gt; OR &lt;expression&gt;  @li Syntax:
&lt;expression&gt; XOR &lt;expression&gt; ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix "

Add a probabilistic term prefix.

void Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix(const std::string &field, const
std::string &prefix)

For example:

This allows the user to search for author:Orwell which will be
converted to a search for the term \"Aorwell\".

Multiple fields can be mapped to the same prefix. For example, you can
make title: and subject: aliases for each other.

As of 1.0.4, you can call this method multiple times with the same
value of field to allow a single field to be mapped to multiple
prefixes. Multiple terms being generated for such a field, and
combined with  Xapian::Query::OP_OR.

If any prefixes are specified for the empty field name (i.e. you call
this method with an empty string as the first parameter) these
prefixes will be used for terms without a field specifier. If you do
this and also specify the default_prefix parameter to  parse_query(),
then the default_prefix parameter will override.

If the prefix parameter is empty, then \"field:word\" will produce the
term \"word\" (and this can be one of several prefixes for a
particular field, or for terms without a field specifier).

If you call  add_prefix() and  add_boolean_prefix() for the same value
of field, a  Xapian::InvalidOperationError exception will be thrown.

In 1.0.3 and earlier, subsequent calls to this method with the same
value of field had no effect.

Parameters:
-----------

field:  The user visible field name

prefix:  The term prefix to map this to ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_boolean_prefix "

Add a boolean term prefix allowing the user to restrict a search with
a boolean filter specified in the free text query.

void Xapian::QueryParser::add_boolean_prefix(const std::string &field,
const std::string &prefix, bool exclusive)

For example:

This allows the user to restrict a search with site:xapian.org which
will be converted to Hxapian.org combined with any probabilistic query
with  Xapian::Query::OP_FILTER.

If multiple boolean filters are specified in a query for the same
prefix, they will be combined with the  Xapian::Query::OP_OR operator.
Then, if there are boolean filters for different prefixes, they will
be combined with the  Xapian::Query::OP_AND operator.

Multiple fields can be mapped to the same prefix (so for example you
can make site: and domain: aliases for each other). Instances of
fields with different aliases but the same prefix will still be
combined with the OR operator.

For example, if \"site\" and \"domain\" map to \"H\", but author maps
to \"A\", a search for \"site:foo domain:bar author:Fred\" will map to
\"(Hfoo OR Hbar) AND Afred\".

As of 1.0.4, you can call this method multiple times with the same
value of field to allow a single field to be mapped to multiple
prefixes. Multiple terms being generated for such a field, and
combined with  Xapian::Query::OP_OR.

Calling this method with an empty string for field will cause a
Xapian::InvalidArgumentError.

If you call  add_prefix() and  add_boolean_prefix() for the same value
of field, a  Xapian::InvalidOperationError exception will be thrown.

In 1.0.3 and earlier, subsequent calls to this method with the same
value of field had no effect.

Parameters:
-----------

field:  The user visible field name

prefix:  The term prefix to map this to

exclusive:  If true, each document can have at most one term with this
prefix, so multiple filters with this prefix should be combined with
OP_OR. If false, each document can have multiple terms with this
prefix, so multiple filters should be combined with OP_AND, like
happens with filters with different prefixes. [default: true] ";

The backends mostly impose a limit on the length of terms (often of
about 240 bytes), but it's generally useful to have a lower limit to
help prevent the index being bloated by useless junk terms from trying
to indexing things like binary data, uuencoded data, ASCII art, etc.

This method was new in Xapian 1.3.1.

Parameters:
-----------

max_word_length:  The maximum length word to index, in bytes in UTF-8
representation. Default is 64. ";

Parameters:
-----------

itor:   Utf8Iterator pointing to the text to index.

wdf_inc:  The wdf increment (default 1).

prefix:  The term prefix to use (default is no prefix). ";

Just like index_text, but no positional information is generated. This
means that the database will be significantly smaller, but that phrase
searching and NEAR won't be supported.

advances the iterator to document id docid_or_slot, or the first
document id after it if there is no value in the slot we're iterating
over for document docid_or_slot.

Note: The \"two-faced\" nature of this method is due to how C++
overloading works. Xapian::docid and Xapian::valueno are both typedefs
for the same unsigned integer type, so overloading can't distinguish
them.

Parameters:
-----------

docid_or_slot:  The docid/slot to advance to. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValueIterator::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::ValueIterator::check(Xapian::docid docid)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database.

This method acts like skip_to() if that can be done at little extra
cost, in which case it then returns true. This is how brass and chert
databases behave because they store values in streams which allow for
an efficient implementation of skip_to().

Otherwise it simply checks if a particular docid is present. If it is,
it returns true. If it isn't, it returns false, and leaves the
position unspecified (and hence the result of calling methods which
depends on the current position, such as get_docid(), are also
unspecified). In this state, next() will advance to the first matching
position after document did, and skip_to() will act as it would if the
position was the first matching position after document did.

Currently the inmemory, flint, and remote backends behave in the
latter way because they don't support streamed values and so skip_to()
must check each document it skips over which is significantly slower.

Parameters:
-----------

docid:  The document id to check. ";

particular, the reopen() method should not be called on it.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource

stored in the specified slot. For example, ValueWeightPostingSource
uses sortable_unserialise to convert values directly to weights.

The upper bound on the weight returned is set to DBL_MAX. Subclasses

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValuePostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

void Xapian::ValuePostingSource::next(Xapian::weight min_wt)

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so next()
must be called before any methods which need the context of the
current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValuePostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::ValuePostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid min_docid,
Xapian::weight min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValuePostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::ValuePostingSource::check(Xapian::docid min_docid,
Xapian::weight min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to check.

%feature("docstring") Xapian::ValueWeightPostingSource "

A posting source which reads weights from a value slot.

This returns entries for all documents in the given database which
have a non empty values in the specified slot. It returns a weight
calculated by applying sortable_unserialise to the value stored in the
slot (so the values stored should probably have been calculated by
applying sortable_serialise to a floating point number at index time).

The upper bound on the weight returned is set using the upper bound on
the values in the specified slot, or DBL_MAX if value bounds aren't
supported by the current backend.

For efficiency, this posting source doesn't check that the stored
values are valid in any way, so it will never raise an exception due
to invalid stored values. In particular, it doesn't ensure that the
unserialised values are positive, which is a requirement for weights.
The behaviour if the slot contains values which unserialise to
negative values is undefined. ";

Xapian::weight Xapian::ValueWeightPostingSource::get_weight() const

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValueWeightPostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

ValueWeightPostingSource* Xapian::ValueWeightPostingSource::clone()

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit "

Commit any pending modifications made to the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit()

For efficiency reasons, when performing multiple updates to a database
it is best (indeed, almost essential) to make as many modifications as
memory will permit in a single pass through the database. To ensure
this, Xapian batches up modifications.

This method may be called at any time to commit any pending
modifications to the database.

If any of the modifications fail, an exception will be thrown and the
database will be left in a state in which each separate addition,
replacement or deletion operation has either been fully performed or
not performed at all: it is then up to the application to work out
which operations need to be repeated.

It's not valid to call commit() within a transaction.

Beware of calling commit() too frequently: this will make indexing
take much longer.

Note that commit() need not be called explicitly: it will be called
automatically when the database is closed, or when a sufficient number
of modifications have been made. By default, this is every 10000
documents added, deleted, or modified. This value is rather
conservative, and if you have a machine with plenty of memory, you can
improve indexing throughput dramatically by setting
XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD in the environment to a larger value.

This method was new in Xapian 1.1.0 - in earlier versions it was
called flush().

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
modifying the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::flush "

Pre-1.1.0 name for commit().

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::flush()

Use commit() instead in new code. This alias may be deprecated in the
future. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::begin_transaction "

Begin a transaction.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::begin_transaction(bool flushed=true)

In Xapian a transaction is a group of modifications to the database
which are linked such that either all will be applied simultaneously
or none will be applied at all. Even in the case of a power failure,
this characteristic should be preserved (as long as the filesystem
isn't corrupted, etc).

A transaction is started with begin_transaction() and can either be
committed by calling commit_transaction() or aborted by calling
cancel_transaction().

By default, a transaction implicitly calls commit() before and after
so that the modifications stand and fall without affecting
modifications before or after.

The downside of these implicit calls to commit() is that small
transactions can harm indexing performance in the same way that
explicitly calling commit() frequently can.

If you're applying atomic groups of changes and only wish to ensure
that each group is either applied or not applied, then you can prevent
the automatic commit() before and after the transaction by starting
the transaction with begin_transaction(false). However, if
cancel_transaction is called (or if commit_transaction isn't called
before the WritableDatabase object is destroyed) then any changes
which were pending before the transaction began will also be
discarded.

Transactions aren't currently supported by the InMemory backend.

Parameters:
-----------

flushed:  Is this a flushed transaction? By default transactions are
\"flushed\", which means that committing a transaction will ensure
those changes are permanently written to the database. By contrast,
unflushed transactions only ensure that changes within the transaction
are either all applied or all aren't.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if transactions are not
available for this database type.

Xapian::InvalidOperationError:  will be thrown if this is called at an
invalid time, such as when a transaction is already in progress. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit_transaction "

Complete the transaction currently in progress.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit_transaction()

If this method completes successfully and this is a flushed
transaction, all the database modifications made during the
transaction will have been committed to the database.

If an error occurs, an exception will be thrown, and none of the
modifications made to the database during the transaction will have
been applied to the database.

In all cases the transaction will no longer be in progress.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
modifying the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a

Add a new document to the database.

Xapian::docid Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_document(const
Xapian::Document &document)

This method adds the specified document to the database, returning a
newly allocated document ID. Automatically allocated document IDs come
from a per-database monotonically increasing counter, so IDs from
deleted documents won't be reused.

If you want to specify the document ID to be used, you should call
replace_document() instead.

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document will either be fully added, or the document fails to be

commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

document:  The new document to be added.

The document ID of the newly added document.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document "

Delete any documents indexed by a term from the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document(const std::string
&unique_term)

This method removes any documents indexed by the specified term from
the database.

A major use is for convenience when UIDs from another system are
mapped to terms in Xapian, although this method has other uses (for
example, you could add a \"deletion date\" term to documents at index
time and use this method to delete all documents due for deletion on a
particular date).

Parameters:
-----------

unique_term:  The term to remove references to.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document "

Replace a given document in the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document(Xapian::docid did,
const Xapian::Document &document)

This method replaces the document with the specified document ID. If
document ID did isn't currently used, the document will be added with
document ID did.

The monotonic counter used for automatically allocating document IDs
is increased so that the next automatically allocated document ID will
be did + 1. Be aware that if you use this method to specify a high
document ID for a new document, and also use
WritableDatabase::add_document(), Xapian may get to a state where this
counter wraps around and will be unable to automatically allocate
document IDs!

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document will either be fully replaced, or the document fails to
be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time when
commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document ID of the document to be replaced.

document:  The new document.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document "

Replace any documents matching a term.

Xapian::docid Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document(const
std::string &unique_term, const Xapian::Document &document)

This method replaces any documents indexed by the specified term with
the specified document. If any documents are indexed by the term, the
lowest document ID will be used for the document, otherwise a new
document ID will be generated as for add_document.

One common use is to allow UIDs from another system to easily be
mapped to terms in Xapian. Note that this method doesn't automatically
add unique_term as a term, so you'll need to call
document.add_term(unique_term) first when using replace_document() in
this way.

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document(s) will either be fully replaced, or the document(s) fail
to be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time
when commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

unique_term:  The \"unique\" term.

document:  The new document.

The document ID that document was given.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_spelling "

Add a word to the spelling dictionary.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_spelling(const std::string &word,
Xapian::termcount freqinc=1) const

If the word is already present, its frequency is increased.

Parameters:
-----------

word:  The word to add.

freqinc:  How much to increase its frequency by (default 1). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::remove_spelling "

then the word is removed completely.

Parameters:
-----------

word:  The word to remove.

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_synonym "

Add a synonym for a term.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_synonym(const std::string &term,
const std::string &synonym) const

Parameters:
-----------

term:  The term to add a synonym for.

synonym:  The synonym to add. If this is already a synonym for term,
then no action is taken. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::remove_synonym "

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::clear_synonyms(const std::string &term)
const

Parameters:
-----------

term:  The term to remove all synonyms for. If the term has no
synonyms, no action is taken. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::set_metadata "

Set the user-specified metadata associated with a given key.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::set_metadata(const std::string &key,
const std::string &value)

This method sets the metadata value associated with a given key. If
there is already a metadata value stored in the database with the same
key, the old value is replaced. If you want to delete an existing item
of metadata, just set its value to the empty string.

User-specified metadata allows you to store arbitrary information in
the form of (key,tag) pairs.

There's no hard limit on the number of metadata items, or the size of
the metadata values. Metadata keys have a limited length, which
depends on the backend. We recommend limiting them to 200 bytes. Empty
keys are not valid, and specifying one will cause an exception.

Metadata modifications are committed to disk in the same way as
modifications to the documents in the database are: i.e.,
modifications are atomic, and won't be committed to disk immediately
(see commit() for more details). This allows metadata to be used to
link databases with versioned external resources by storing the
appropriate version number in a metadata item.

You can also use the metadata to store arbitrary extra information
associated with terms, documents, or postings by encoding the termname
and/or document id into the metadata key.

Parameters:
-----------

key:  The key of the metadata item to set.

value:  The value of the metadata item to set.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state.

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if the key supplied is
empty.

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if the database backend in
use doesn't support user- specified metadata. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Auto::sortable_serialise "

Convert a floating point number to a string, preserving sort order.

std::string Xapian::sortable_serialise(double value)

This method converts a floating point number to a string, suitable for
using as a value for numeric range restriction, or for use as a sort
key.

The conversion is platform independent.

The conversion attempts to ensure that, for any pair of values
supplied to the conversion algorithm, the result of comparing the
original values (with a numeric comparison operator) will be the same
as the result of comparing the resulting values (with a string
comparison operator). On platforms which represent doubles with the
precisions specified by IEEE_754, this will be the case: if the
representation of doubles is more precise, it is possible that two
very close doubles will be mapped to the same string, so will compare
equal.

Note also that both zero and -zero will be converted to the same
representation: since these compare equal, this satisfies the
comparison constraint, but it's worth knowing this if you wish to use
the encoding in some situation where this distinction matters.

Handling of NaN isn't (currently) guaranteed to be sensible.

Parameters:
-----------

value:  The number to serialise. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Auto::sortable_unserialise "

Convert a string encoded using sortable_serialise back to a floating
point number.

double Xapian::sortable_unserialise(const std::string &value)

This expects the input to be a string produced by
sortable_serialise(). If the input is not such a string, the value
returned is undefined (but no error will be thrown).

The result of the conversion will be exactly the value which was
supplied to  sortable_serialise() when making the string on platforms
which represent doubles with the precisions specified by IEEE_754, but
may be a different (nearby) value on other platforms.

Parameters:
-----------

value:  The serialised string to decode. ";
