<div class="document" id="overview">
<h1 class="title">Overview</h1>

<p>This document provides an introduction to the native C++ Xapian API.
This API provides programmers with the ability to index and search
through (potentially very large) bodies of data using probabilistic
methods.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The portion of the API currently documented here covers only the
part of Xapian concerned with searching through existing databases, not
that concerned with creating them.</p>
<p>This document assumes you already have Xapian installed, so if you
haven't, it is a good idea to read <a class="reference external" href="install.html">Installing Xapian</a>
first.</p>
<p>You may also wish to read the <a class="reference external" href="quickstart.html">QuickStart</a> reference,
for some simple worked examples of Xapian usage, and the <a class="reference external" href="intro_ir.html">Introduction
to Information Retrieval</a> for a background into the
Information Retrieval theories behind Xapian.</p>
<p>This document does not detail the exact calling conventions (parameters
passed, return value, exceptions thrown, etc...) for each method in the
API. For such documentation, you should refer to the automatically
extracted documentation, which is generated from detailed comments in
the source code, and should thus remain up-to-date and accurate. This
documentation is generated using the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> application. To save you having
to generate this documentation yourself, we include the <a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/index.html">built
version</a> in our distributions, and also keep
the <a class="reference external" href="http://xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/index.html">latest version</a> on
our website.</p>
<div class="section" id="design-principles">
<h1>Design Principles</h1>
<p>API classes are either very lightweight or a wrapper around a reference
counted pointer (this style of class design is sometimes known as PIMPL
for &quot;Private IMPLementation&quot;). In either case copying is a cheap
operation as classes are at most a few words of memory.</p>
<p>API objects keep a reference to other objects they rely on so the user
doesn't need to worry about whether an object is still valid or not.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, API classes can be used as containers and iterators
just like those in the C++ STL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="errors-and-exceptions">
<h1>Errors and exceptions</h1>
<p>It is important to understand the errors which may be caused by the
operations which you are trying to perform.</p>
<p>This becomes particularly relevant when using a large system, with such
possibilities as databases which are being updated while you search
through them, and distributed enquiry systems.</p>
<p>Errors in Xapian are all reported by means of exceptions. All exceptions
thrown by Xapian will be subclasses of
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Error.html">Xapian::Error</a>. Note that
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Error</span></tt> is an abstract class; thus you must catch exceptions
by reference rather than by value.</p>
<p>There are two flavours of error, derived from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Error</span></tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1LogicError.html">Xapian::LogicError</a>
- for error conditions due to programming errors, such as a misuse of
the API. A finished application should not receive these errors
(though it would still be sensible to catch them).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1RuntimeError.html">Xapian::RuntimeError</a>
- for error conditions due to run time problems, such as failure to
open a database. You must always be ready to cope with such errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these flavours is further subdivided, such that any particular
error condition can be trapped by catching the appropriate exception. If
desired, a human readable explanation of the error can be retrieved by
calling
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Error.html">Xapian::Error::get_msg()</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, standard system errors may occur: these will be reported by
throwing appropriate exceptions. Most notably, if the system runs out of
memory, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::bad_alloc</span></tt> exception will be thrown.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminology">
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<div class="section" id="databases">
<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>These may also occasionally be called <em>Indexes</em>. In Xapian (as opposed
to a database package) a database consists of little more than indexed
documents: this reflects the purpose of Xapian as an information
retrieval system, rather than an information storage system.</p>
<p>The exact contents of a database depend on the type (see &quot;<a class="reference external" href="#database_types">Database
Types</a>&quot; for more details of the database types
currently provided).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="queries">
<h2>Queries</h2>
<p>The information to be searched for is specified by a <em>Query</em>. In Xapian,
queries are made up of a structured boolean tree, upon which
probabilistic weightings are imposed: when the search is performed, the
documents returned are filtered according to the boolean structure, and
weighted (and sorted) according to the probabilistic model of
information retrieval.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memory-handling">
<h1>Memory handling</h1>
<p>The user of Xapian does not usually need to worry about how Xapian
performs its memory allocation: Xapian objects can all be created and
deleted as any other C++ objects. The convention is that whoever creates
an object is ultimately responsible for deleting it. This becomes
relevant when passing a pointer to data to Xapian: it will be the caller's
responsibility to delete the object once it is finished with.  Where
an object is set by one API call and used by another, Xapian will assume
that such pointers remain valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-xapian-enquire-class">
<h1>The Xapian::Enquire class</h1>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Enquire.html">Xapian::Enquire</a>
class is central to all searching operations. It provides an interface
for</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Specifying the database, or databases, to search across.</li>
<li>Specifying a query to perform.</li>
<li>Specifying a set of documents which a user considers relevant.</li>
<li>Given the supplied information, returning a ranked set of documents
for the user.</li>
<li>Given the supplied information, suggesting a ranked set of terms to
add to the query.</li>
<li>Returning information about the documents which matched, such as
their associated data, and which terms from the query were found
within them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical enquiry session will consist of most of these operations, in
various orders. The Xapian::Enquire class presents as few restrictions
as possible on the order in which operations should be performed.
Although you must set the query before any operation which uses it, you
can call any of the other methods in any order.</p>
<p>Many operations performed by the Xapian::Enquire class are performed
lazily (ie, just before their results are needed). This need not concern
the user except to note that, as a result, errors may not be reported as
soon as would otherwise be expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specifying-a-database">
<h1>Specifying a database</h1>
<p>When creating a Xapian::Enquire object, a database to search must be
specified. Databases are specified by creating a <a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Database.html">Xapian::Database
object</a>. Generally, you can
just construct the object, passing the pathname to the database. Xapian
looks at the path and autodetects the database type.</p>
<p>In some cases (with the Remote backend, or if you want more control) you
need to use a factory function such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Flint::open()</span></tt> - each
backend type has one or more. The parameters the function takes depend
on the backend type, and whether we are creating a read-only or a
writable database.</p>
<p>You can also create a &quot;stub database&quot; file which lists one or more
databases. These files are recognised by the autodetection in the
Database constructor (if the pathname is file rather than a directory,
it's treated as a stub database file) or you can open them explicitly
using Xapian::Auto::open_stub(). The stub database format specifies one
database per line. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
remote localhost:23876
flint /var/spool/xapian/webindex
</pre>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Database types</h2>
<p>The current types understood by Xapian are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>auto</dt>
<dd>This isn't an actual database format, but rather auto-detection of one of
the disk based backends (e.g. &quot;flint&quot; or &quot;chert&quot;) from a single specified
path (which can be to a file or directory).</dd>
<dt>brass</dt>
<dd>Brass is the current development backend, and it is intended to be the
default backend in Xapian 1.4.x.</dd>
<dt>chert</dt>
<dd>Chert is the default backend in Xapian 1.2.x. It supports incremental
modifications, concurrent single-writer and multiple-reader access to a
database. It's very efficient and highly scalable.</dd>
<dt>flint</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Flint was the default backend in Xapian 1.0.x. It supports incremental
modifications, concurrent single-writer and multiple-reader access to a
database. It's very efficient and highly scalable. Flint takes lessons
learned from studying Quartz in action, and is appreciably faster (both
when indexing and searching), more compact, and features an improved
locking mechanism which automatically releases the lock if a writing
process dies.</p>
<p class="last">For more information, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/FlintBackend">Xapian Wiki</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>inmemory</dt>
<dd>This type is a database held entirely in memory. It was originally written
for testing purposes only, but may prove useful for building up temporary
small databases.</dd>
<dt>quartz</dt>
<dd>Quartz was the default backend prior to Xapian 1.0, and has been removed as
of Xapian 1.1.0. If you want to migrate an existing Quartz database to
Flint, <a class="reference external" href="admin_notes.html#converting-a-quartz-database-to-a-flint-database%60">see the 'Admin Notes'</a>
for a way to do this.</dd>
<dt>remote</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This can specify either a &quot;program&quot; or TCP remote backend, for example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
remote :ssh xapian-prog.example.com xapian-progsrv
</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
remote xapian-tcp.example.com:12345
</pre>
<p class="last">If the first character of the second word is a colon (<tt class="docutils literal">:</tt>), then this is
skipped and the remainder of the line is used as the command to run
xapian-progsrv and the &quot;program&quot; variant of the remote backend is used.
Otherwise the TCP variant of the remote backend is used, and the rest of
the line specifies the host and port to connect to.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-databases">
<h2>Multiple databases</h2>
<p>Xapian can search across several databases as easily as searching across
a single one. Simply call
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Database.html">Xapian::Database::add_database()</a>
for each database that you wish to search through.</p>
<p>You can also set up &quot;pre-canned&quot; listed of databases to search over
using a &quot;stub database&quot; - see above for details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specifying-a-query">
<h1>Specifying a query</h1>
<p>Xapian implements both boolean and probabilistic searching. There are
two obvious ways in which a pure boolean query could be combined with a
pure probabilistic query:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First perform the boolean search to create a subset of the whole
document collection, and then do the probabilistic search on this
subset, or</li>
<li>Do the probabilistic search, and then filter out the resulting
documents with a boolean query.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is in fact a subtle difference in these two approaches. In the
first, the collection statistics for the probabilistic query will be
determined by the document subset which is obtained by running the
boolean query. In the second, the collection statistics for the
probabilistic query are determined by the whole document collection.
These differences can affect the final result.</p>
<p>Suppose for example the boolean query is being used to retrieve
documents in English in a database containing English and French
documents. A word like &quot;<em>grand</em>&quot;, exists in both languages (with similar
meanings), but is more common in French than English. In the English
subset it could therefore be expected to have a higher weight than it
would get in the joint English and French databases.</p>
<p>Xapian takes the second approach simply because this can be implemented
very efficiently. The first approach is more exact, but inefficient to
implement.</p>
<p>Rather than implementing this approach as described above and first
performing the probabilistic search and then filtering the results,
Xapian actually performs both tasks simultaneously. This allows various
optimisations to be performed, such as giving up on calculating a
boolean AND operation when the probabilistic weights that could result
from further documents can have no effect on the result set. These
optimisations have been found to often give a several-fold performance
increase. The performance is particularly good for queries containing
many terms.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-query-for-a-single-term">
<h2>A query for a single term</h2>
<p>A search query is represented by a
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Query.html">Xapian::Query</a> object. The
simplest useful query is one which searches for a single term (and
several of these can be combined to form more complex queries). A single
term query can be created as follows (where <tt class="docutils literal">term</tt> is a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::string</span></tt> holding the term to be searched for):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::Query query(term);
</pre>
<p>A term in Xapian is represented simply by a string of bytes.  Usually, when
searching text, these bytes will represent the characters of the word which
the term represents, but during the information retrieval process Xapian
attaches no specific meaning to the term.</p>
<p>This constructor actually takes a couple of extra parameters, which may
be used to specify positional and frequency information for terms in the
query:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::Query(const string &amp; tname_,
        Xapian::termcount wqf_ = 1,
        Xapian::termpos term_pos_ = 0)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">wqf</tt> (Within Query Frequency) is a measure of how common a term is
in the query. This isn't useful for a single term query unless it is going
to form part of a more complex query. In that case, it's particularly
useful when generating a query from an existing document, but may also be
used to increase the &quot;importance&quot; of a term in a query. Another way to
increase the &quot;importance&quot; of a term is to use <tt class="docutils literal">OP_SCALE_WEIGHT</tt>. But if
the intention is simply to ensure that a particular term is in the query
results, you should use a boolean AND or AND_MAYBE rather than setting a
high wqf.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">term_pos</tt> represents the position of the term in the query.
Again, this isn't useful for a single term query by itself, but is used
for phrase searching, passage retrieval, and other operations which
require knowledge of the order of terms in the query (such as returning
the set of matching terms in a given document in the same order as they
occur in the query). If such operations are not required, the default
value of 0 may be used.</p>
<p>Note that it may not make much sense to specify a wqf other than 1 when
supplying a term position (unless you are trying to affect the
weighting, as previously described).</p>
<p>Note also that the results of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query(tname,</span> 2)</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR,</span> <span class="pre">Xapian::Query(tname),</span> <span class="pre">Xapian::Query(tname))</span></tt>
are exactly equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compound-queries">
<h2>Compound queries</h2>
<p>Compound queries can be built up from single term queries by combining
them a connecting operator. Most operators can operate on either a
single term query or a compound query. You can combine pair-wise using
the following constructor:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::op op_,
        const Xapian::Query &amp; left,
        const Xapian::Query &amp; right)
</pre>
<p>The two most commonly used operators are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query::OP_AND</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query::OP_OR</span></tt>, which enable us to construct boolean queries
made up from the usual AND and OR operations. But in addition to this, a
probabilistic query in its simplest form, where we have a list of terms
which give rise to weights that need to be added together, is also made
up from a set of terms joined together with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query::OP_OR</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Some of the available <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query::op</span></tt> operators are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="22%" />
<col width="78%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>Xapian::Query::OP_AND</td>
<td>Return documents returned by both subqueries.</td>

</tr>

</div>
<div class="section" id="understanding-queries">

<p>Each term in the query has a weight in each document. Each document may
also have an additional weight not associated with any of the terms. By
default the probabilistic weighting scheme <a class="reference external" href="bm25.html">BM25</a> is used
to provide the formulae which give these weights.</p>
<p>A query can be thought of as a tree structure. At each node is an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Query::op</span></tt> operator, and on the left and right branch are two
other queries. At each leaf node is a term, t, transmitting documents
and scores, D and w<sub>D</sub>(t), up the tree.</p>
<p>A Xapian::Query::OP_OR node transmits documents from both branches up
the tree, summing the scores when a document is found in both the left
and right branch. For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>A Xapian::Query::OP_AND_MAYBE node transmits the documents up the tree
from the left branch only, but adds in the score from the right branch

<p>Xapian::Query::OP_FILTER is like Xapian::Query::OP_AND, but weights
are only transmitted from the left branch. For example,</p>

<p>Xapian::Query::OP_XOR is like Xapian::Query::OP_OR, but documents on
both left and right branches are not transmitted up the tree. For
example,</p>

scores  3.1 3.2  3.1  3.8 ...    4.2 4.1 4.5  4.7 ...
</pre>
<p>A query can therefore be thought of as a process for generating an MSet
from the terms at the leaf nodes of the query. Each leaf node gives rise
to a posting list of documents with scores. Each higher level node gives
rise to a similar list, and the root node of the tree contains the final
set of documents with scores (or weights), which are candidates for
going into the MSet. The MSet contains the documents which get the
highest weights, and they are held in the MSet in weight order.</p>
<p>It is important to realise that within Xapian the structure of a query
is optimised for best performance, and it undergoes various
transformations as the query progresses. The precise way in which the
query is built up is therefore of little importance to Xapian - for
example, you can AND together terms pair-by-pair, or combine several
using AND on a std::vector of terms, and Xapian will build the same
structure internally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-queries">
<h2>Using queries</h2>
<div class="section" id="probabilistic-queries">
<h3>Probabilistic queries</h3>
<p>A plain probabilistic query is created by connecting terms together with
Xapian::Query::OP_OR operators. For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::Query query(&quot;regulation&quot;);
query = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, query, Xapian::Query(&quot;import&quot;));
query = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, query, Xapian::Query(&quot;export&quot;));
query = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, query, Xapian::Query(&quot;canned&quot;));
query = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, query, Xapian::Query(&quot;fish&quot;));
</pre>
<p>This creates a probabilistic query with terms `regulation', `import',
`export', `canned' and `fish'.</p>
<p>In fact this style of creation is so common that there is the shortcut
construction:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vector&lt;string&gt; terms;
terms.push_back(&quot;regulation&quot;);
terms.push_back(&quot;import&quot;);
terms.push_back(&quot;export&quot;);
terms.push_back(&quot;canned&quot;);

<div class="section" id="boolean-queries">
<h3>Boolean queries</h3>
<p>Suppose now we have this Boolean query,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
('EEC' - 'France') and ('1989' or '1991' or '1992') and 'Corporate_Law'
</pre>
<p>This could be built up as bquery like this,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::Query bquery1(Xapian::Query::OP_AND_NOT, &quot;EEC&quot;, &quot;France&quot;);

Xapian::Query bquery2(&quot;1989&quot;);
bquery2 = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, bquery2, &quot;1991&quot;);
bquery2 = Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_OR, bquery2, &quot;1992&quot;);

Xapian::Query bquery(Xapian::Query::OP_AND, bquery1, Xapian::Query(Xapian::Query::OP_AND(bquery2, bquery3)));

<div class="section" id="plus-and-minus-terms">
<h3>Plus and minus terms</h3>
<p>A common requirement in search engine functionality is to run a

of the retrieved documents (`-' terms). For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
regulation import export +canned +fish -japan

<p>the corresponding query can be set up by,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vector&lt;string&gt; plus_terms;

<div class="section" id="retrieving-the-results-of-a-query">
<h1>Retrieving the results of a query</h1>
<p>To get the results of the query, call the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enquire::get_mset()</span></tt> method:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Xapian::MSet Xapian::Enquire::get_mset(Xapian::doccount first,

</pre>
<p>When asking for the results, you must specify (in <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt>) the first
item in the result set to return, where the numbering starts at zero (so
a value of zero corresponds to the first item returned being that with
the highest score, and a value of 10 corresponds to the first 10 items
being ignored, and the returned items starting at the eleventh).</p>
<p>You must also specify (in <tt class="docutils literal">maxitems</tt>) the maximum number of items to
return. Unless there are not enough matching items, precisely this
number of items will be returned. If <tt class="docutils literal">maxitems</tt> is zero, no items will
be returned, but the usual statistics (such as the maximum possible
weight which a document could be assigned by the query) will be
calculated. (See &quot;The Xapian::MSet&quot; below).</p>
<div class="section" id="the-xapian-mset">
<h2>The Xapian::MSet</h2>
<p>Query results are returned in an
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1MSet.html">Xapian::MSet</a> object. The
results can be accessed using a
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1MSetIterator.html">Xapian::MSetIterator</a>
which returns the matches in descending sorted order of relevance (so
the most relevant document is first in the list). Each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::MSet</span></tt>
entry comprises a document id, and the weight calculated for that
document.</p>
<p>An <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::MSet</span></tt> also contains various information about the search
result:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>firstitem</dt>
<dd>The index of the first item in the result which was put into the MSet.
(Corresponding to <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Enquire::get_mset()</span></tt>)</dd>
<dt>max_attained</dt>
<dd>The greatest weight which is attained in the full results of the search.</dd>
<dt>max_possible</dt>
<dd>The maximum possible weight in the MSet.</dd>
<dt>docs_considered</dt>
<dd>The number of documents matching the query considered for the MSet. This
provides a lower bound on the number of documents in the database which
have a weight greater than zero. Note that this value may change if the
search is recalculated with different values for <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">max_items</tt>.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="accessing-a-document">
<h2>Accessing a document</h2>
<p>A document in the database is accessed via a
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Document.html">Xapian::Document</a>
object. This can be obtained by calling
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Database.html">Xapian::Database::get_document()</a>.
The returned <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Document</span></tt> is a reference counted handle so
copying is cheap.</p>
<p>Each document can have the following types of information associated
with it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>document data - this is an arbitrary block of data accessed using
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Document.html">Xapian::Document::get_data()</a>.
The contents of the document data can be whatever you want and in
whatever format. Often it contains fields such as a URL or other
external UID, a document title, and an excerpt from the document
text. If you wish to interoperate with Omega, it should contain
name=value pairs, one per line (recent versions of Omega also support
one field value per line, and can assign names to line numbers in the
query template).</li>
<li>terms and positional information - terms index the document (like
index entries in the back of a book); positional information records
the word offset into the document of each occurrence of a particular
term. This is used to implement phrase searching and the NEAR
operator.</li>
<li>document values - these are arbitrary pieces of data which are stored
so they can be accessed rapidly during the match process (to allow
sorting collapsing of duplicates, etc). Each value is stored in a
numbered slot so you can have several for each document. There's
currently no length limit, but you should keep them short for
efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's some overlap in what you can do with terms and with values. A
simple boolean operator (e.g. document language) is definitely better
done using a term and OP_FILTER.</p>
<p>Using a value allows you to do things you can't do with terms, such as
&quot;sort by price&quot;, or &quot;show only the best match for each website&quot;. You can
also perform filtering with a value which is more sophisticated than can
easily be achieved with terms, for example: find matches with a price
between $100 and $900. Omega uses boolean terms to perform date range
filtering, but this might actually be better done using a value (the
code in Omega was written before values were added to Xapian).</p>

<div class="section" id="specifying-a-relevance-set">
<h1>Specifying a relevance set</h1>
<p>Xapian supports the idea of relevance feedback: that is, of allowing the
user to mark documents as being relevant to the search, and using this
information to modify the search. This is supported by means of
relevance sets, which are simply sets of document ids which are marked
as relevant. These are held in
<a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1RSet.html">Xapian::RSet</a> objects, one
of which may optionally be supplied to Xapian in the <tt class="docutils literal">rset</tt>
parameter when calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Enquire::get_mset()</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="section" id="match-options">
<h2>Match options</h2>
<p>There are various additional options which may be specified when
performing the query. These are specified by calling <a class="reference external" href="apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Enquire.html">various methods of
the Xapian::Enquire object</a>.
The options are as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>collapse key</dt>
<dd>Each document in a database may have a set of numbered value slots. The
contents of each value slot is a string of arbitrary length. The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set_collapse_key(Xapian::valueno</span> collapse_key)</tt> method specifies a
value slot number upon which to remove duplicates. Only the most
recently set duplicate removal key is active at any time, and the
default is to perform no duplicate removal.</dd>
<dt>percentage cutoff</dt>
<dd>It may occasionally be desirable to exclude any documents which have a
weight less than a given percentage value. This may be done using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set_cutoff(Xapian::percent</span> percent_cutoff)</tt>.</dd>
<dt>sort direction</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Some weighting functions may frequently result in several documents being
returned with the same weight. In this case, by default, the documents will
be returned in ascending document id order. This can be changed by using

<p class="last"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set_docid_order(Xapian::Enquire::DESCENDING)</span></tt> may be useful, for
example, when it would be best to return the newest documents, and new

by default).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="match-decision-functors">
<h2>Match decision functors</h2>
<p>Sometimes it may be useful to return only documents matching criteria
which can't be easily represented by queries. This can be done using a
match decision functor. To set such a condition, derive a class from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::MatchDecider</span></tt> and override the function operator,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operator()(const</span> <span class="pre">Xapian::Document</span> &amp;doc)</tt>. The operator can make a
decision based on the document values via
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Document::get_value(Xapian::valueno)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The functor will also have access to the document data stored in the
database (via <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::Document::get_data()</span></tt>), but beware that for
most database backends, this is an expensive operation to be calling
for a lot of documents, so doing that is likely to slow down the search
considerably.</p>

<p>By default terms which are already in the query will never be returned
by <tt class="docutils literal">get_eset()</tt>. If <tt class="docutils literal">exclude_query_terms</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>) then query
terms may be returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-exact-termfreq">
<h2>use_exact_termfreq</h2>
<p>By default, Xapian uses an approximation to the term frequency when
<tt class="docutils literal">get_eset()</tt> is called when searching over multiple databases. This
approximation improves performance, and usually still returns good
results. If you're willing to pay the performance penalty, you can get
Xapian to calculate the exact term frequencies by passing <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> for
<tt class="docutils literal">use_exact_termfreq</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expand-decision-functors">
<h2>Expand decision functors</h2>
<p>It is often useful to allow only certain classes of term to be returned
in the expand set. For example, there may be special terms in the
database with various prefixes, which should be removed from the expand
set. This is accomplished by providing a decision functor. To do this,
derive a class from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xapian::ExpandDecider</span></tt> and override the function
operator, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operator()(const</span> string &amp;)</tt>. The functor is called with
each term before it is added to the set, and it may accept (by returning
<tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>) or reject (by returning <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>) the term as appropriate.</p>

<div class="section" id="thread-safety">
<h1>Thread safety</h1>
<p>There's no pthread specific code in Xapian. If you want to use the same
object concurrently from different threads, it's up to you to police
access (with a mutex or in some other way) to ensure only one method is
being executed at once. The reason for this is to avoid adding the
overhead of locking and unlocking mutexes when they aren't required. It
also makes the Xapian code easier to maintain, and simplifies building
it.</p>
<p>For most applications, this is unlikely to be an issue - generally the
calls to Xapian are likely to be from a single thread. And if they
aren't, you can just create an entirely separate Xapian::Database object
in each thread - this is no different to accessing the same database
from two different processes.</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Extensively documented examples of simple usage of the Xapian API for
creating databases and then for searching through them are given in the
<a class="reference external" href="quickstart.html">QuickStart</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>Further examples of usage of Xapian are available in the examples
subdirectory of xapian-core.</p>
