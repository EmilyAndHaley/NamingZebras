<Description>
This directory contains example programs which use the Xapian library.
These programs are intended to be a good starting point for those trying
to get acquainted with the Xapian API.  Some of them are really just
toy programs, but others are actually useful utilities in their own
right (for example: delve, quest, and copydatabase).
