/** Calculate the edit distance between two sequences.
 *
 *  Edit distance is defined as the minimum number of edit operations
 *  required to move from one sequence to another.  The edit operations
 *  considered are:
 *   - Insertion of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Deletion of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Substitution of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Transposition of two neighbouring characters at an arbitrary position
 *     in the string.
 *
 *  @param ptr1 A pointer to the start of the first sequence.
 *  @param len1 The length of the first sequence.
 *  @param ptr2 A pointer to the start of the second sequence.
 *  @param len2 The length of the first sequence.
 *  @param max_distance The greatest edit distance that's interesting to us.
 *			If the true edit distance is > max_distance, any
 *			value > max_distance may be returned instead (which
 *			allows the edit distance algorithm to avoid work for
 *			poor matces).
 *
 *  @return The edit distance from one item to the other.
