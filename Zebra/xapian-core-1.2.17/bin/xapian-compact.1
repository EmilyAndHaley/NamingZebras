[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fISOURCE_DATABASE\fR... \fIDESTINATION_DATABASE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
xapian\-compact \- Compact a database, or merge and compact several
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-blocksize\fR
Set the blocksize in bytes (e.g. 4096) or K (e.g. 4K)
(must be between 2K and 64K and a power of 2, default 8K)
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-full\fR
Disable full compaction
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fuller\fR
Enable fuller compaction (not recommended if you plan to
update the compacted database)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multipass\fR
If merging more than 3 databases, merge the postlists in
multiple passes (which is generally faster but requires
more disk space for temporary files)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-renumber\fR Preserve the numbering of document ids (useful if you have
external references to them, or have set them to match
unique ids from an external source).  Currently this
option is only supported when merging databases if they
have disjoint ranges of used document ids
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
