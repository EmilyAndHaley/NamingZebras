<Description>
The MultiDatabase backend, which enables
searches to be performed across several databases.  Opening this
database involves opening each of the sub-databases and merging
them together.

Searches are performed across the sub-databases via MultiPostList
and MultiTermList objects, which represent merged sets of postlist
and termlist objects.
