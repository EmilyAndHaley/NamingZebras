<Directory>backends</Directory>

<Description>
This directory contains a subdirectory for each of the available database
backends.  Each backend corresponds to a different underlying file
structure.  For example, the inmemory backend holds its databases
entirely in RAM, and the flint backend is a fully featured disk based
backend.

The directory also contains the implementation of Xapian::Database::Internal
(the base class for each backend database class) and the factory functions
which are the public interface for instantiating the database backend classes.
