<Description>
Chert is the default backend for the Xapian 1.2.x release series.
It uses a custom written Btree management system to store
posting lists and termlists.  This is a highly efficient
backend, using compression to store the postlists, and supporting the
full range of indexing functionality (positional information, transactions,
etc).
